Project Description

*Samosa Angle Detector* is a fun image processing project that calculates the angle of a samosa from a user-uploaded image. 
Using Python and OpenCV, it detects the samosa's triangular shape and computes its apex angle, blending food with geometry in a quirky and creative way.


The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Find the angle of the samosa for better eating

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We have found the angle of the samosa.

This HTML page lets users upload a samosa image, then shows its three detected angles and the processed image, or an error if detection fails.

This Python function detects a triangle in an image, calculates its three angles, draws the triangle with angle labels, and saves the output image.

This is a Samosa Angle Detector web interface. It allows users to upload a photo of a samosa, analyzes it to detect triangle corners, calculates the three internal angles, and displays both the angle values and the processed image with angles overlaid.
